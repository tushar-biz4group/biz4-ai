# Task ID: 2
# Title: Set Up FastAPI Backend
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL connection.
# Details:
Set up FastAPI project, configure PostgreSQL connection, and ensure environment variables are managed securely.

# Test Strategy:
Run FastAPI server locally and verify connection to PostgreSQL.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize FastAPI Project [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new FastAPI project structure and install necessary dependencies.
### Details:
Create a new directory for the FastAPI project. Initialize a virtual environment and install FastAPI using pip. Set up a basic project structure with main.py as the entry point. Verify the installation by running a simple FastAPI application that returns a 'Hello World' message.

## 2. Configure PostgreSQL Connection [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Set up the connection to a PostgreSQL database using an ORM like SQLAlchemy.
### Details:
Install SQLAlchemy and asyncpg for database interaction. Create a database configuration file to manage connection details. Use SQLAlchemy to define a database engine and session. Test the connection by creating a simple model and performing basic CRUD operations.

## 3. Manage Environment Variables Securely [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Implement secure management of environment variables for database credentials and other sensitive information.
### Details:
Install python-dotenv to manage environment variables. Create a .env file to store sensitive information like database URL, username, and password. Update the FastAPI application to load these variables securely at runtime. Ensure the .env file is added to .gitignore to prevent it from being committed to version control.
