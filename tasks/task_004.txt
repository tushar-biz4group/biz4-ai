# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement User Authentication Endpoints
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop FastAPI endpoints for user signup, login, and password management.
# Details:
Implement endpoints: POST /signup, POST /login, POST /forgot-password, POST /verify-code, POST /reset-password. Use bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for session management.

# Test Strategy:
Use Postman to test each endpoint for expected responses and error handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement User Signup and Login Endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the POST /signup and POST /login endpoints using FastAPI. Ensure password hashing with bcrypt and JWT token generation for session management.
### Details:
Start by setting up the FastAPI application and creating the necessary models for user data. Implement the /signup endpoint to accept user registration details, hash the password using bcrypt, and store the user data in the database. For the /login endpoint, validate user credentials, compare the hashed password, and generate a JWT token for successful logins. Ensure proper error handling and response formatting.

## 2. Implement Password Management Endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop the POST /forgot-password, POST /verify-code, and POST /reset-password endpoints to handle password recovery and reset processes.
### Details:
Create the /forgot-password endpoint to initiate the password recovery process by sending a verification code to the user's email. Implement the /verify-code endpoint to validate the code provided by the user. Finally, develop the /reset-password endpoint to allow users to set a new password, ensuring it is hashed with bcrypt before updating the database. Ensure all endpoints have appropriate validation and error handling.

## 3. Integrate and Test Authentication Endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Integrate all authentication endpoints into the FastAPI application and perform thorough testing to ensure functionality and security.
### Details:
Integrate the developed endpoints into the main FastAPI application, ensuring they are properly registered and accessible. Write unit and integration tests to verify the functionality of each endpoint, focusing on edge cases and security aspects like password hashing, JWT token generation, and validation. Use tools like pytest for testing and ensure all tests pass successfully before deployment.
