# Subtasks:
## 1. Create GitHub Repository and Initialize with README and .gitignore [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new GitHub repository for the project and initialize it with a README file and a .gitignore file.
### Details:
Log in to GitHub and create a new repository. Name the repository appropriately to reflect the project. Initialize the repository with a README file to provide an overview of the project. Add a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from being tracked, using templates for Node.js and Python to cover both frontend and backend needs.

## 2. Set Up Initial Directory Structure for React Native Frontend [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create the initial directory structure for the React Native frontend within the repository.
### Details:
Clone the newly created GitHub repository to your local machine. Inside the repository, create a directory named 'frontend'. Within this directory, set up the basic structure for a React Native project, including directories for components, assets, and any other necessary subdirectories. Use 'npx react-native init' to initialize a new React Native project within the 'frontend' directory.

## 3. Set Up Initial Directory Structure for FastAPI Backend [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create the initial directory structure for the FastAPI backend within the repository.
### Details:
Within the cloned repository, create a directory named 'backend'. Inside this directory, set up the basic structure for a FastAPI project, including directories for app modules, static files, and templates if needed. Initialize a virtual environment and install FastAPI and Uvicorn. Create a main.py file as the entry point for the FastAPI application.
