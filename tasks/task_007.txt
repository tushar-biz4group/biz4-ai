# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Formik for Form Handling [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate Formik into the project to manage form state and handle submissions.

### Description: Add real-time validation for the email field to ensure it follows a valid email format.
### Details:
Use Formik's validationSchema or validate function to define a validation rule for the email field. Utilize a library like Yup to specify that the email field must match a standard email regex pattern. Display error messages below the email input field when the validation fails.

## 3. Implement Password Strength Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Add real-time validation for the password field to enforce password strength rules.
### Details:
Define password strength criteria, such as minimum length, inclusion of numbers, and special characters. Use Formik's validationSchema or validate function to apply these rules to the password field. Display error messages below the password input field when the validation fails, providing feedback on which criteria are not met.
